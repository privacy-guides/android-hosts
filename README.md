# android-hosts
This is a small repository that has many different of hosts files with certain use-cases. It's meant to be used with the F-Droid version of Netguard https://github.com/M66B/NetGuard | https://www.netguard.me .

DISCLAMER: If you want true privacy & security on an Android, you should be using: https://calyxos.org/

No configuration of Netguard will provide more protection for Android then CalyxOS can provide using its build in firewall.
(I don't recommend using MicroG or any Google Related Service on any form of device.)
If you want to know if your app of choice works on CalyxOS/GrapheneOS/Any Degoogled Rom?
Use: https://plexus.techlore.tech/ - Provided by Techlore. 
Search your app of choice and it will show if your app is compatible with any degoogled rom.

Why use a Custom Host file with Netguard?
Netguard is an amazing piece of software that allows you to firewall the traffic on an Android, giving you control what apps can or can't use network/cellular data.
Example: Samsungapps & Services phone home a lot, way to block this? Netguard block all apps except the ones that you use & NEED network to function properly.
Reminder: blocking Google (using the anti-[Google]) will block nearly all functionality in Google related apps & Background telementry. 
There are thousand better alternative to their eco-system. 


How to Download the 'Right' Version of Netguard?
1) Download F-Droid: https://www.f-droid.org/ on the mobile device.
2) After installing F-Droid make sure to update all it's repos.
3) Search Netguard & Install the latest version (just press install).
4) Go to Netguard -> Settings -> Backup -> You should see "import hosts file", "import hosts file (append)", "hosts file download URL", "Download hosts file".
   If this isn't the case, you downloaded the wrong version from the Google Play Store. Go back to Step 1.
